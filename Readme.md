##Dear fellow students,

If you're also an IntelliJ user, and wouldn't want to go through the steps of setting up a VM, or just want to stick to your good old favourite IDE, look no further!

This example project helps to kickstart your work. Clone this repo, open as a maven project in intelliJ, and you're as close to starting as i can get you.

###Some course specific things i can't remotely set up for you:
####Colorcodes for coverage testing:
The default washed out colours of intelliJ in general match what the multiple choice questions would ask for. However if you prefer to use the colors they force: <br>

    1. #####Full: Green (bright)
    2. #####Partial: Yellow (bright)
    3. #####Uncovered: Red (bright)

You may need to install `maven` on your computer separately. If you need to, don't forget to add it to your system environment variables.
[The website to download it](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) has a fairly good guide for everything. To use `maven` to run your tests refer to the `JUnit` [manual](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/)

_Don't forget to put the test files for the assignments into the test folder (:_

####Do you want to have this sample project in your own github repo?
